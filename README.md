  1-1 Summary
    
    * The GAN architecture is relatively straightforward, although one aspect that remains challenging for beginners is the topic of GAN loss functions.
    
    * The discriminator model is updated like any other deep learning neural network, although the generator uses the discriminator as the loss function, meaning that **the loss function for the generator is implicit and learned during training.
